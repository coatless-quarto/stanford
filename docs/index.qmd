The `stanford` Quarto theme extension provides **unofficial** Stanford University theming for Quarto documents. 

:::{.callout-note}
This extension was made for a guest lecture inside of STATS 352 to show the versatility of Quarto.
:::

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template coatless-quarto/stanford
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Example

For each format, there is a template file available. See:

- **Beamer:** [Slide Demo](assets/template-beamer.pdf) ([Source](https://github.com/coatless-quarto/stanford/blob/main/asset-generation/template-beamer.qmd))
- **HTML:** [HTML Page Demo](assets/template-html.html) ([Source](https://github.com/coatless-quarto/stanford/blob/main/asset-generation/template-html.qmd))
